In 2024 I traced a blind spot in our school ERP that exposed marksheets for every student.

Rather than flexing the vulnerability, I documented the session replay, proved the impact, and
presented a zero-downtime patch to the administrator within 48 hours.

The school rewarded me publicly, nicknamed me the "Cyber Boy" of the campus, and I learned that
responsible disclosure is the fastest route to trust.
